        <p>Dear Sathvika,</p>
        <p>
          I guess since my first letter did not reach you (curses upon your name USPS), this will have to do. 
          It's a difficult task to put into words how much love there is for you in my heart, but I'll try 
          at the cost of this â€” whatever this is â€” becoming a bit lengthy. From the beginning, I was convinced
          that you and I would work out, no matter what distances or time zones separated us, and for this reason I've 
          never once doubted that fact. Now that I cannot hold you for the time being, your face and our memories cross
          my mind more often than you can think, and I'm constantly awaiting the day when you run into my arms and I
          never have to let go. I'm the happiest man in the world, now that you have entered my life, and I will always
          be grateful to you for accepting the invitation I posed that Diwali day. Please never fear that I might lose
          these emotions, for your well-being and happiness is my own. If this is not true love, then I fear that I may 
          never experience it at all. I love you so much, Sathvika Sitaraman, and I count down the days till we meet again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love,<br>
          Anand
        </p>
